# üìÅ Spark Model Implementations

This repository contains implementations of three machine learning models using Apache Spark and PySpark MLlib. Each notebook demonstrates a specific ML task: classification, clustering, and recommendation.

# Files Overview
### 1. Classification Model (classification_model.ipynb)
Implements a classification model using Spark's MLlib.
Dataset: Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or open source).
Model: Random Forest.
Key Steps:
  Spark session initialization.
  Load and explore the Titanic dataset.
Data preprocessing:
  Dropped unnecessary columns.
  Converted categorical Sex column to numeric.
  Used VectorAssembler to prepare feature vectors.
Train/test split.
Model training using Logistic Regression.
Predictions and evaluation using accuracy metric.
