# üìÅ Spark Model Implementations

This repository contains implementations of three machine learning models using Apache Spark and PySpark MLlib. Each notebook demonstrates a specific ML task: classification, clustering, and recommendation.

# Files Overview
### üî¢ 1. Classification Model (classification_model.ipynb)
* Implements a classification model using Spark's MLlib.
* Dataset: Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or open source).
* Model: Random Forest.
* Key Steps:
  * Spark session initialization.
  * Load and explore the Titanic dataset.
* Data preprocessing:
  * Dropped unnecessary columns.
  * Converted categorical Sex column to numeric.
  * Used VectorAssembler to prepare feature vectors.
* Train/test split.
* Model training using Logistic Regression.
* Predictions and evaluation using accuracy metric.

### üß≠ 2. Clustering Model (clustering_model.ipynb)
* Implements a clustering model using Spark's MLlib.
* Dataset: Wholesale customers dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).
* Model: KMeans clustering.
* Key Steps:
  * Spark session initialization.
  * Load the customer dataset.
  * Assembled numerical features using VectorAssembler.
  * Trained a KMeans model to cluster customer types.
  * Predicted clusters for each customer.
  * Evaluated using Silhouette Score.
  * Displayed cluster centers.

 ### üé¨ 3. Recommendation Engine (recommendation_engine.ipynb)
* Implements a movie recommendation engine using Spark's ALS algorithm.
* Dataset: MovieLens ratings dataset (ratings.csv and movies.csv from ml-latest-small).
* Model: Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
* Key Steps:
  * Spark session initialization.
  * Loaded and joined ratings.csv with movies.csv.
  * Defined explicit schema for safe parsing.
  * Split data into train and test sets.
  * Trained ALS model with user, movie, and rating columns.
  * Evaluated model using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE).
  * Generated:
    * Top-N recommendations for each user.
    * Personalized recommendations with movie titles.
